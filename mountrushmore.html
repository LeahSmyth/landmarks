<p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore, a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture&rsquo;s design and oversaw the project&rsquo;s execution with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. Mount Rushmore features 60-foot sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865).</p>

<p>After securing federal funding, construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist. Lack of funding forced construction to end on October 31, 1941.</p>

<p>Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States, and it has appeared in works of fiction, as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works. It attracts over two million visitors annually.</p>
