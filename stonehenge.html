 <p>Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England. Stonehenge&rsquo;s ring of standing stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.</p>        
        
<p>One of the most famous landmarks in the UK, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon. It has been a legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1882 when legislation to protect historic monuments was first successfully introduced in Britain. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.</p>
        
<p>In 1986, Stonehenge became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
