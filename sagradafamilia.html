<p>The Bas&iacute;lica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia is a large unfinished Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud&iacute; (1852–1926). Gaud&iacute;&rsquo;'s work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>In 1882, construction started under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud&iacute; took over as chief architect. Gaud&iacute; devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and at the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. </p>

<p> Describing Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia, art critic Rainer Zerbst said &ldquo;it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art&rdquo;, and Paul Goldberger describes it as &ldquo;the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages&rdquo;.</p>
