 <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the world&rsquo;s largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 1,400 miles over an area of approximately 33,000 sq miles. The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia.</p>        
        
<p>The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world&rsquo;s biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland.</p>
